        'Three Ways to Survive in a Ruined World' was a feature-length fantasy novel
        with 3,149 chapters. Its shortened name was 'Ways of Survival.'

        I have been steadily reading this novel since the third year of middle school. I
        read it during the time when I was bullied by iljins [1], when I ruined my
        entrance examinations and had to enter a local university, when the damned
        random draw went wrong and I was placed in the military unit at the forefront,

        affiliate of a large company ... Damn, let's stop talking about this. Anyway ...

        of 10 years. There was a mixture of despondency that a world was coming to an
        end along with a sense of satisfaction. I opened the comment box of the last
        message and rewrote the sentence several times. 32

        -Kim Dokja: Writer, thank you for everything in the meantime. I am looking
        forward to the epilogue.

        They were sincere sentences. Ways of Survival was my life's novel. It wasn't the
        most popular, but it was the best novel for me. There were many words I
        wanted to say but I couldn't write them. I was afraid that my careless words
